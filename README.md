This project was made for an internship task. It is a simple painting application that works on Android devices.

# Features:
-  Three different size of brushes that will leave a thin residue of selected color behind 
-  Bucket, it will paint canvas until it reaches different color line (made by using Flood Fill Algorithm)
-  Sprite, which will work once per click and draw a sprite to the clicked area, dragging wonâ€™t do anything.
-  Eraser, it will paint original color of canvas over everything else to the clicked area
-  Color picker wheel for brushes and bucket
-  Application will take the user to an empty canvas if playing for the first time. If played before, will take the user to the previously drawn canvas
-  It has music loops and sound effects for while painting, erasing etc.
